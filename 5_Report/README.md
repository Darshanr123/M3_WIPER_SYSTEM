ABSTRACT:

Today’s car wipers are manual systems that work on the principle of manual switching. So here we propose an automatic wiper system that automatically switches ON on
detecting rain and stops when the rain stops. Our project brings forward this system to automate the wiper system
not need manual intervention. For this purpose, we use a rain sensor along with a microcontroller to drive the wiper
motor. Our system uses a rain sensor to detect rain, this signal is then processed by a microcontroller to take the
desired action. The rain sensor works on the principle of using water for completing its circuit, so when rain falls
on it, the circuit gets completed and sends out a signal to the microcontroller. The microcontroller now processes this
data and controls the motor.

1. AUTOMATIC CAR WIPER SYSTEM IN BMW CARS:==>

These days, even non-luxury compact and family cars are available with rain-sensing wipers.
These systems utilize an LED sensor, fitted between the windshield and rearview mirror, to detect the amount of rain or snow falling on the windshield.
There are a number of infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and a central photodiode which make up the “rain sense” portion of the system.
The invisible light emitted by the LEDs is reflected by the windshield onto the photo sensor. 
Therefore the more moisture there is on the windshield, the less light the sensor receives. 
This information is subsequently relayed to a computer control unit, which then adjusts the intermittent wiper delay intervals of the accordingly.
The wetter it gets, the faster the rain sensing wipers work to help give you a clear view of what's in front of you.
When the system senses drier conditions, such as when the vehicle is stopped at a red light and the rain is falling less intensely,
the wipers will gradually slow down before switching themselves off when no longer needed. Say goodbye to chattering windshield wiper blades!


2. AUTOMATIC CAR WIPER SYSTEM IN VOLKSWAGEN CARS:==>

The rain sensors automatically regulate the frequency of your windscreen wipers, according to how heavily it is raining.
Our rain sensors mean you won't have to keep switching your wipers on and off, or adjusting their speed, according to how hard it is raining. 
This clever system uses an LED sensor, fitted behind your internal mirror, to detect the amount of rain falling on your windscreen and adjusts the wiper accordingly.
You can also choose different settings, depending on how sensitive you want the rain sensor to be. 
If you choose the most sensitive setting the wipers will clean off just a few spots of rain, whilst the least sensitive setting will wait a little longer before
starting to work. And you don't even have to worry about reversing. When the sensor is on and you select reverse gear,
the rear wipers will automatically wipe away any rain.The sensor system consists of a number of infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and a central photodiode.
The light emitted by the LEDs is reflected by the windscreen onto the photo sensor. The more drops of water there are on the windscreen, 
the less light the sensor receives. This information is passed to an electronic control unit, which adapts the wipe intervals of the windscreen wiper accordingly.
And the design means that dirt, minor defects and ageing of the windscreen do not impair its efficiency. 
You'll find driving in wet conditions safer and more comfortable because the rain sensor does the hard work, leaving you to concentrate fully on the road.
It's especially useful in situations when your visibility is suddenly impaired - while overtaking lorries on a wet road, for example.


3. AUTOMATIC CAR WIPER SYSTEM IN VOLVO CARS:==>

The rain sensor automatically starts the windscreen wipers based on how much water it detects on the windscreen.
Rain sensor sensitivity can be adjusted with the thumbwheel on the right-hand stalk switch.

ACTIVATING THE RAIN SENSOR:

When activating the rain sensor, the car must be running or the electrical system in ignition position I or II while the windscreen wiper stalk 
switch must be in position 0 or in the position for a single sweep. Activate the rain sensor by pressing the rain sensor button .
Press the stalk switch down for the wipers to make an extra sweep.
Turn the thumbwheel upward for higher sensitivity and downward for lower sensitivity. An extra sweep is made when the thumbwheel is turned upward.

DEACTIVATING THE RAIN SENSOR:

Deactivating the rain sensor
Deactivate the rain sensor by pressing the rain sensor button  or moving the stalk switch up to another wiper program.
The rain sensor is deactivated automatically in ignition position 0 or when the engine is switched off.
The rain sensor is deactivated automatically when wiper blades are set in service position. The rain sensor is reactivated when service mode has been deactivated.
