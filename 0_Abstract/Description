ABSTRACT:

Today’s car wipers are manual systems that work on the principle of manual switching. So here we propose an automatic wiper system that automatically switches ON on
detecting rain and stops when the rain stops. Our project brings forward this system to automate the wiper system
not need manual intervention. For this purpose, we use a rain sensor along with a microcontroller to drive the wiper
motor. Our system uses a rain sensor to detect rain, this signal is then processed by a microcontroller to take the
desired action. The rain sensor works on the principle of using water for completing its circuit, so when rain falls
on it, the circuit gets completed and sends out a signal to the microcontroller. The microcontroller now processes this
data and controls the motor.
